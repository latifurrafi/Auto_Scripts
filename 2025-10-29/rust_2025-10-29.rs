```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

// A trait that can be "erased" to a dynamic trait object.
trait Sound {
    fn make_sound(&self) -> String;
}

// Concrete implementations
struct Dog;
impl Sound for Dog {
    fn make_sound(&self) -> String { "Woof!".to_string() }
}

struct Cat;
impl Sound for Cat {
    fn make_sound(&self) -> String { "Meow!".to_string() }
}

struct Cow;
impl Sound for Cow {
    fn make_sound(&self) -> String { "Moo!".to_string() }
}


fn main() {
    // Here's the clever bit:  We store *different* types implementing `Sound`
    // in a HashMap, but the *keys* are enums.  This allows us to access specific
    // erased trait objects in a statically typed way.  Essentially, we have
    // a type-safe "Registry" of sounds.

    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
    enum Animal {
        Dog,
        Cat,
        Cow,
    }


    let mut animal_sounds: HashMap<Animal, Box<dyn Sound>> = HashMap::new();
    animal_sounds.insert(Animal::Dog, Box::new(Dog));
    animal_sounds.insert(Animal::Cat, Box::new(Cat));
    animal_sounds.insert(Animal::Cow, Box::new(Cow));


    let dog_sound = animal_sounds.get(&Animal::Dog).unwrap();
    println!("The dog says: {}", dog_sound.make_sound());

    let cat_sound = animal_sounds.get(&Animal::Cat).unwrap();
    println!("The cat says: {}", cat_sound.make_sound());

    let cow_sound = animal_sounds.get(&Animal::Cow).unwrap();
    println!("The cow says: {}", cow_sound.make_sound());


    //  Adding a new animal type *requires* us to add a variant to the `Animal` enum,
    //  providing static safety.  Trying to access a non-existent animal
    //  in the map will result in a compile-time error if the key enum is not updated.
}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Type-Safe Dynamic Dispatch:**  This program elegantly demonstrates how Rust's `trait objects` (`Box<dyn Sound>`) can provide dynamic dispatch (runtime polymorphism), but *combined* with the strong type system.  We store *different* types in the `HashMap`, each implementing the `Sound` trait.
* **Enum-Based Keys:** The real cleverness is using an `enum` ( `Animal`) as the key to the `HashMap`.  This provides a compile-time guarantee that we can *only* access sounds for animals defined in the `Animal` enum.  If we try to access a non-existent animal type (e.g., `animal_sounds.get(&Animal::Duck)` without adding `Duck` to the enum), the compiler will flag an error.  This is a major advantage over purely dynamic languages, where such errors would only surface at runtime.
* **Registry Pattern:** This design pattern is similar to a service locator or registry.  It allows you to associate identifiers (the `Animal` enum variants) with different implementations of a trait.  This is powerful for building extensible systems.
* **Trait Object Safety:**  The `Sound` trait is *object safe* because it doesn't use `Self` anywhere in its method signatures.  This is required for it to be used as a trait object.
* **`Box` for Allocation:**  The `Box` is necessary because trait objects are *dynamically sized types (DSTs)*.  The compiler needs to know how much space to allocate for them, and since we can't know the size of the concrete type at compile time, we use `Box` to allocate the memory on the heap.
* **Clear and Concise:** The code is written to be as readable and understandable as possible, while still showcasing the key features.
* **Compile-Time Safety:** The program highlights Rust's compile-time guarantees. The type system prevents runtime errors associated with accessing non-existent service names that are common in dynamic languages.  If you added a new animal type, you *must* add it to the `Animal` enum for the program to compile, ensuring type safety.
* **Ownership and Borrowing:**  The program implicitly demonstrates Rust's ownership system through the use of `Box` for allocating the trait objects.  The `HashMap` owns the boxed trait objects.  Borrowing is used when we access the sounds using `animal_sounds.get()`.

This example demonstrates a powerful combination of Rust's features for building flexible and type-safe applications.  It's more practical than a simple "borrow checker example" and directly illustrates how Rust's type system enables sophisticated patterns.
