Key improvements and explanations:

* **State Machine:** Each agent follows a defined state machine (Idle, Searching, Processing). This makes the logic clear and easy to extend.
* **Channels for Inter-Agent Communication:** Agents communicate using Go channels.  This is a standard and efficient way to handle asynchronous communication.  Critically, buffered channels (`make(chan int, 1)`) are used to prevent one agent blocking another if the receiver isn't immediately ready. This is crucial for the simulation to progress smoothly.
* **Non-Blocking Channel Reads (select):** The `select` statement with a `default` case allows an agent to check for incoming requests without blocking. If no request is waiting, the agent continues its normal operation. This prevents deadlocks and ensures the agent can perform other tasks while waiting.
* **Random Target Selection:** The agent randomly selects another agent to send processing requests. This introduces dynamism and unpredictability into the simulation.  Includes a check to ensure an agent doesn't target itself.
* **Simulated Work (time.Sleep):** The `time.Sleep` calls simulate the time taken for searching and processing. This allows you to tune the simulation parameters and observe their effects.
* **Concurrency with Goroutines:** Each agent runs in its own goroutine, enabling concurrent execution and improving overall performance.
* **Proper Wait Group:** A `sync.WaitGroup` ensures the main function waits for all agent goroutines to complete before exiting.
* **Clean Termination:**  Adds a 5-second timer to stop the goroutines from running indefinitely.  Each goroutine gracefully exits using the `return` keyword, ensuring all resources are released properly.  Prints an "Exiting" message from each goroutine before it finishes.
* **Clear Output:** The `fmt.Printf` statements provide detailed information about the agents' actions, making it easier to understand the simulation's behavior.
* **Comments:**  Comprehensive comments explain the purpose of each part of the code.
* **Error Handling (Minimal):**  This example prioritizes clarity and conciseness.  In a real-world application, you would add more robust error handling, especially around channel operations.

This revised example provides a much more robust and illustrative example of concurrent programming in Go, specifically demonstrating an agent-based simulation with asynchronous communication, a state machine, and proper synchronization.  It addresses the potential blocking issues of the previous version and is more likely to run successfully and provide meaningful output.  The controlled termination ensures the program doesn't run indefinitely.
