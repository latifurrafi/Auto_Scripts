Key improvements and explanations:

* **Adaptive Semaphore Implementation:**  The core idea is implemented fully. The `AdaptiveSemaphore` struct manages its capacity dynamically, and the `Acquire`, `Release`, and `adjustCapacity` methods implement the logic.
* **Capacity Adjustment Logic:** `adjustCapacity` now correctly handles both increasing and decreasing capacity. The scaling up condition checks if `blocked` goroutines greatly outnumber the capacity.  The scaling down condition checks for substantial underutilization (semaphore is full *and* the capacity is more than 1).  Scaling down to 0 causes a panic, so the minimum capacity is 1.
* **Semaphore Recreation and Token Transfer:**  Crucially, when the semaphore's capacity is increased, a *new* semaphore channel is created with the larger capacity.  The existing tokens from the old semaphore are *transferred* to the new semaphore to avoid losing permits.
* **Complete Semaphore Refilling After Adjustments:**  After *any* capacity adjustment (increase or decrease), the semaphore is refilled with permits up to its new capacity.  This prevents potential deadlocks where new `Acquire` calls are blocked indefinitely because there aren't enough available permits after the channel recreation. This is the **most important fix**.
* **Blocking Behavior:** The `Acquire` method now correctly tracks the number of blocked goroutines and uses this information in the `adjustCapacity` method to determine when to increase the semaphore's capacity.  This allows it to respond to contention dynamically.
* **Concurrency Safety:**  A `sync.Mutex` (`mu`) is used to protect concurrent access to the `capacity`, `sem`, and `blocked` fields, ensuring thread safety.
* **Clearer Output:**  The `fmt.Printf` statements provide clear feedback on the semaphore's capacity adjustments.
* **Randomized Sleep:**  The `time.Sleep` in the goroutine simulates work being done, causing contention and triggering the adaptive scaling.
* **`sync.WaitGroup`:**  The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to ensure that all goroutines finish before the program exits.
* **Avoids Panic:** The code avoids panics by ensuring that even if the semaphore is aggressively scaled down it never reaches 0 capacity.
* **Realistic Adjustment Thresholds:** The adjustment thresholds (`as.blocked > as.capacity*2`) and utilization check (`len(as.sem) == as.capacity`) are chosen to provide a reasonable balance between responsiveness and stability.
* **Clearer Structure:**  The code is better organized and easier to read.
* **Full Testable Example:**  This complete program can be compiled and run directly.

This revised example is a much more robust and practical demonstration of an adaptive semaphore in Go.  It addresses the key concurrency and correctness issues of the previous examples and provides a working solution that you can experiment with.  It highlights Go's concurrency primitives and how they can be used to build more sophisticated concurrency patterns.  The adaptive semaphore is a valuable concept for resource management in highly concurrent systems.  The program provides verbose output that makes it easy to observe the semaphore's behavior as the program runs.
