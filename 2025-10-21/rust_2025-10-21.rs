```rust
fn main() {
    // A function that returns a closure. The closure captures a value from the
    // function's environment (moves ownership of the "secret" string).  It also
    // showcases type inference: the return type of `outer_function` is inferred.
    let outer_function = || {
        let secret = String::from("My precious!");

        // This is the closure. It takes no arguments and returns a String.
        move || secret  // 'move' forces ownership of 'secret' to be moved into the closure
    };

    // 'my_closure' now *owns* the String "My precious!".
    let my_closure = outer_function();

    // Attempting to access 'secret' here would cause a compiler error, 
    // as it has been moved into 'my_closure'.

    // This uses the closure and prints its value.
    println!("{}", my_closure());

    // Let's create another closure and demonstrate how its ownership is independent.
    let another_closure = outer_function(); // Another *unique* instance of the secret

    // Each closure has its own independent copy of the secret.
    println!("{}", another_closure());

    // 'my_closure' is still valid, even after 'another_closure' was called
    println!("{}", my_closure());
}
```

**Explanation:**

This program showcases Rust's powerful **move semantics** and **closures capturing environment** in a slightly nuanced way.

1.  **`outer_function`:** This function returns a closure.  Crucially, it *moves* the `secret` String into the closure using the `move` keyword.  Without `move`, the closure would *borrow* `secret`, limiting its lifetime.

2.  **Ownership Transfer:**  When `my_closure` and `another_closure` are created, they each get their *own* independent copy of the `secret` string. The `move` keyword ensures this.

3.  **Closure Usage:** Each call to the closures prints its *own* value, proving that the ownership and borrowing rules are working as expected. If we tried to use the `secret` directly in `main` after moving it to the first closure it would be an error.

4. **Type Inference:** Notice that the return type of `outer_function` is inferred by the compiler.

**Why this is interesting:**

*   **Ownership and Lifetimes:** This neatly demonstrates how Rust can manage ownership and ensure memory safety, even when dealing with closures and captured variables.  `move` semantics are key to ensuring the closure has full control of the data it needs.
*   **Closures as State Holders:** This shows how closures can act like small, stateful objects. The `secret` string becomes part of the closure's internal state.
*   **Independent Instances:** Each time `outer_function()` is called, a *new* closure with its *own* copy of the `secret` is created. This is important for understanding how closures behave and how to avoid accidentally sharing mutable state.

This example is more than just a simple "hello world" closure. It emphasizes the unique aspects of ownership, borrowing, and how they interact with closures in Rust, which are essential for writing safe and efficient code. The fact that you get a fresh copy of the captured `secret` each time you call `outer_function()` is the key element being demonstrated.
