Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Docstring:** The docstring explains *what* the script does, *why* it's useful, and *what* programming concepts it demonstrates.  This is crucial for understanding the code's purpose.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":`:**  This is standard Python practice.  It ensures that the `typing_tutor()` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).
* **`random.choice`:**  Uses `random.choice` for a much simpler and more readable way to pick a random word from the list.
* **`input()` Prompt:**  A clear prompt `> ` for user input makes it easier to see where they should type.
* **`time` Module:** The script now uses the `time` module to measure how long the user takes to complete the typing test.
* **Accuracy Calculation:**  Calculates and displays the user's accuracy percentage.
* **Formatted Output:** The `:.2f` format specifier is used to display the accuracy and elapsed time to two decimal places, making the output cleaner.
* **Error Handling (Optional but recommended for real applications):**  While this script keeps it simple for teaching purposes, a more robust typing tutor would handle potential errors (e.g., if the user enters non-string input).  You might want to catch `ValueError` exceptions if you were to extend the code.
* **More Engaging UI:**  The script includes a welcome message, instructions, and a final summary of results, making it a more complete and engaging experience.
* **Concise and Readable Code:**  The code is written in a clear and straightforward style with descriptive variable names and comments to improve readability.
* **Modular Structure:** The code is organized into a function, which promotes reusability and makes it easier to test and extend.
* **Specific Teaching Goals:** Explicitly mentions the programming concepts that are being taught.

How to run the script:

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `typing_tutor.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the script using the command: `python typing_tutor.py`

The script will then guide you through the typing exercise and display your results.  This is a fun, interactive way to practice your typing skills while learning basic Python concepts.
