}
```

**Explanation and Why it's Interesting:**

1. **Const Generics:**  The program leverages Rust's (still `incomplete_features`!) const generics.  `Summation<const N: usize>` defines a struct parameterized by a compile-time constant integer `N`. This is a key feature allowing us to perform calculations during compilation.

2. **Type-Level Recursion:**  The magic happens within the `VALUE` constant.  The associated constant `VALUE` of `Summation<N>` is defined using a recursive compile-time calculation:
   - If `N` is 0, the value is 0 (base case).
   - Otherwise, it calculates `Summation::<{ N - 1 }>::VALUE + N`. This recursively calls the `VALUE` constant for a smaller `N` until it reaches the base case.  The `{N - 1}` syntax is crucial for const generics to represent the subtraction, which must be performed at compile time.

3. **Compile-Time Evaluation:** Because `VALUE` is a `const`, the entire summation calculation is performed by the compiler *at compile time*.  The resulting `SUM_TO_TEN` variable is simply a constant integer value.

4. **Zero Runtime Cost (in release mode):** In a release build (`cargo build --release`), the compiler can optimize away the `runtime_sum` calculation and the assertion.  The `SUM_TO_TEN` value is known at compile time and will be directly embedded in the compiled binary.

5. **Showcases a powerful (but incomplete) feature:** Const generics combined with recursion allows for very powerful compile-time computations. This program demonstrates a simple example of what's possible, opening the door to things like compile-time matrix operations, data structure generation, and more.

**How to Run It:**

1.  Save the code as `src/main.rs`.
2.  You will need to enable the `const_generics` feature:
    ```bash
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    rustup default nightly
    ```
3.  Build and run: `cargo run`

**Output:**

```
The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is: 55
Runtime calculation: 55
```

**Caveats:**

*   **`incomplete_features`:**  This program requires the `const_generics` feature, which is still under development.  Expect potential changes in the future.
*   **Stack Overflow (compile-time):**  If you try to calculate the sum of a very large number (e.g., `Summation::<10000>::VALUE`), you may encounter a compile-time stack overflow. The compiler has limits on the depth of recursion it will allow during constant evaluation.
*   **Compile Times:** Complex compile-time calculations can significantly increase compilation times.

This example highlights the potential of Rust's const generics to enable highly performant and type-safe code by moving computations from runtime to compile time.  It's a glimpse into the future of Rust programming.
