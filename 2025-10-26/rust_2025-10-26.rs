```rust
fn main() {
    // This program demonstrates type-level programming with const generics and traits,
    // to calculate the factorial of a number at compile time.

    // Define a trait to compute factorial.
    trait Factorial {
        const VALUE: u128;
    }

    // Implement the trait for a struct parameterized by a const generic N.
    struct Fact<const N: u128>;

    // Base case: Factorial of 0 is 1.
    impl Factorial for Fact<0> {
        const VALUE: u128 = 1;
    }

    // Recursive case: Factorial of N is N * Factorial of (N-1).
    impl<const N: u128> Factorial for Fact<N>
    where
        Fact<{ N - 1 }>: Factorial, // Requires const expression to be known at compile time
    {
        const VALUE: u128 = N * Fact::<{ N - 1 }>::VALUE;
    }

    // Calculate the factorial of 5 at compile time.
    const FACTORIAL_5: u128 = Fact::<5>::VALUE;

    // Print the result, which is pre-calculated and embedded in the binary.
    println!("Factorial of 5 is: {}", FACTORIAL_5);

    // You can calculate other factorials too!
    // Note:  Large values might lead to overflow.
    const FACTORIAL_8: u128 = Fact::<8>::VALUE;
    println!("Factorial of 8 is: {}", FACTORIAL_8);
}
```

**Explanation of Key Features:**

* **Const Generics:** `struct Fact<const N: u128>`  The `const N: u128` part declares a const generic parameter `N` of type `u128`. This allows us to parameterize the type `Fact` with a constant value known at compile time.
* **Traits:** The `Factorial` trait defines a `VALUE` constant.  Traits allow us to define shared behavior (in this case, computing the factorial) across different types.
* **Type-Level Programming:**  The calculation of the factorial happens *at compile time* through type inference and trait implementations. The compiler essentially "runs" the factorial function during compilation.
* **Compile-Time Evaluation:**  The `const FACTORIAL_5: u128 = Fact::<5>::VALUE;` line forces the compiler to evaluate `Fact::<5>::VALUE` at compile time. The result is then embedded directly into the compiled binary.  This leads to zero runtime overhead for the factorial calculation.
* **Recursive Trait Implementation:** The `impl<const N: u128> Factorial for Fact<N> ...` block implements the factorial recursively. Notice the `Fact::<{ N - 1 }>: Factorial` where clause. This tells the compiler that `Fact::<N>` implements `Factorial` *only if* `Fact::<{ N - 1 }>` also implements `Factorial`. This recursion continues until the base case `Fact::<0>` is reached.

**Why this is interesting:**

* **Performance:** Because the factorial is computed at compile time, the program runs extremely efficiently. There's no runtime calculation required.
* **Type Safety:** The compile-time nature of this calculation can catch potential errors (like overflow) during compilation, instead of at runtime.
* **Advanced Rust Features:** This example combines several advanced Rust features (const generics, traits, type-level programming) to achieve a powerful and elegant solution.
* **Metaprogramming:** This showcases a simple form of metaprogramming in Rust, where the program's behavior is determined at compile time based on type information.

To compile and run:

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

The output will be:

```
Factorial of 5 is: 120
Factorial of 8 is: 40320
```

The compiler performs all the heavy lifting *before* the program even starts running.  This makes the program exceptionally fast and efficient for tasks that can be known at compile time.
