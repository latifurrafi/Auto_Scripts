```rust
fn main() {
    // This program showcases the power of compile-time evaluation and generics
    // to generate custom lookup tables based on a boolean condition.

    const fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
        match n {
            0 => 0,
            1 => 1,
            _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
        }
    }

    // Define a trait for table generation.
    trait TableGenerator {
        const TABLE: [u32; 5];
    }

    // Implement the trait for a "Fibonacci Table" if the condition is true.
    struct FibonacciTable;
    impl TableGenerator for FibonacciTable {
        const TABLE: [u32; 5] = [
            fibonacci(1),
            fibonacci(2),
            fibonacci(3),
            fibonacci(4),
            fibonacci(5),
        ];
    }

    // Implement the trait for a "Squared Table" if the condition is false.
    struct SquaredTable;
    impl TableGenerator for SquaredTable {
        const TABLE: [u32; 5] = [1*1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4, 5*5];
    }


    // Use a boolean constant to choose which table to use at compile time.
    const USE_FIBONACCI: bool = true;

    // Conditionally define a type alias based on the boolean constant.
    type SelectedTable = if USE_FIBONACCI { FibonacciTable } else { SquaredTable };

    // Access the table.
    let table = SelectedTable::TABLE;

    println!("Generated Table: {:?}", table);
}
```

**Explanation and Key Features Showcased:**

1. **`const fn` (Constant Functions):** The `fibonacci` function is declared as `const fn`.  This means it can be evaluated at compile time if all its inputs are known at compile time. This is crucial because it lets us pre-compute the Fibonacci numbers *before* the program even runs, creating a more efficient lookup table.  If `USE_FIBONACCI` is false, then the much simpler squared table calculation is done at compile time.

2. **Generics (via Traits):** The `TableGenerator` trait defines a contract for types that can generate lookup tables.  The `FibonacciTable` and `SquaredTable` structs implement this trait, providing different implementations of the `TABLE` constant array.

3. **`if` in Type Aliases (Conditional Compilation):**  The heart of the cleverness is the line:

   ```rust
   type SelectedTable = if USE_FIBONACCI { FibonacciTable } else { SquaredTable };
   ```

   This uses a feature of Rust that allows you to define type aliases conditionally based on a compile-time constant (`USE_FIBONACCI`).  This determines which `TableGenerator` implementation is selected *at compile time*. The compiler knows exactly what type `SelectedTable` is *before* the program executes.

4. **Compile-Time Evaluation:**  The entire lookup table (`SelectedTable::TABLE`) is computed at compile time.  This means that when the program runs, it simply accesses a pre-computed array.  This avoids runtime calculations and makes the program faster (especially if the `fibonacci` function were more complex).  If you compile with optimizations (`cargo build --release`), the compiler might even inline the table directly into the `println!` statement!

**How it Works:**

* The `USE_FIBONACCI` constant controls which table is generated.
* Based on the value of `USE_FIBONACCI`, the `SelectedTable` type alias is resolved to either `FibonacciTable` or `SquaredTable`.
* The `table` variable then gets assigned the `TABLE` associated constant from the selected table type.
* The `println!` macro prints the resulting table.

**Why it's Unique and Clever:**

* **Compile-Time Logic:** It demonstrates how to perform logic (choosing between table generation methods) *during compilation* rather than at runtime.
* **Type-Level Programming:** It's a mild form of type-level programming, where types are used to represent data and perform calculations. The choice of which calculation to perform is embedded in the type system.
* **Zero-Cost Abstraction:**  The conditional type alias and trait usage have virtually no runtime overhead. The compiler optimizes away the abstractions, resulting in efficient code.
* **Illustrates Rust's Power:** It combines several powerful features of Rust (const fns, generics, conditional compilation) in a concise example to create something interesting.

To run the code:

1.  Save it as `src/main.rs` in a new Rust project.
2.  Use `cargo run` to execute the program. Try changing the `USE_FIBONACCI` constant to see how the output changes. Also, try building in release mode (`cargo build --release`) and see how the compiler optimizes.
