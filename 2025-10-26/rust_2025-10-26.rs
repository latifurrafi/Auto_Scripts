```rust
// A program that demonstrates compile-time array size computation using const generics
// and ensures array access safety with bounds checking.

#![feature(generic_const_exprs)] // Enables const generics for array sizes.
#![allow(incomplete_features)] // Suppresses warnings about `generic_const_exprs`.

// Calculate the size of an array based on a constant input integer.
const fn array_size<const N: usize>() -> usize {
    N * 2 + 1 // Size will always be an odd number
}

// A function that operates on an array of a size determined at compile time.
fn process_array<const N: usize>(data: &[i32; array_size::<N>()]) {
    println!("Processing array of size: {}", data.len());

    // Access the middle element.  Safe because array_size always returns an odd number
    // and bounds checking is enabled by default in Rust, catching out-of-bounds accesses.
    let middle_index = data.len() / 2;
    println!("Middle element: {}", data[middle_index]);
}


fn main() {
    // Create an array with a size computed at compile time.
    const ARRAY_SIZE: usize = array_size::<5>(); // N = 5 => size = 5 * 2 + 1 = 11

    let my_array: [i32; ARRAY_SIZE] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11];

    // Pass the array to the processing function.
    process_array::<5>(&my_array);

    // Compile-time error if we tried an out-of-bounds access, guaranteed by Rust's safety.
    // Uncommenting this would result in a panic during execution (if it even compiles with
    // less optimized targets).  However, compile-time size calculation prevents such runtime
    // possibilities in more complex scenarios because we know the size ahead of time.
    //  println!("{}", my_array[ARRAY_SIZE]); // ERROR: index out of bounds: the length is 11 but the index is 11

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`generic_const_exprs`**:  This feature allows you to perform calculations with `const` generics *within the type system*.  This is the core of the example.  Previously, `array_size` would not be valid as a compile-time constant for array sizes. The `#![feature(...)]` and `#![allow(...)]` lines are necessary to enable and silence warnings about this still-unstable feature.

* **Compile-Time Calculation:** The `array_size::<N>()` function is declared `const`.  This forces the compiler to evaluate it *at compile time* whenever possible.  This ensures that `ARRAY_SIZE` and the array size in `process_array` are known *before* the program even runs.

* **Array Size Safety:**  Rust's built-in bounds checking is still in effect.  Even though the size is calculated at compile time, an attempt to access `my_array[ARRAY_SIZE]` would still panic at runtime (if the compiler even allowed it),  because `ARRAY_SIZE` is equal to the length of the array, and valid indices are 0 to length - 1.

* **`process_array` function:** This function takes an array reference `&[i32; array_size::<N>()]`.  Critically, the array *size* is a `const` generic parameter. This connects the array's size to the compile-time value of `N`.

* **Clear Demonstration of Const Generics:** The program clearly demonstrates how const generics can be used to compute array sizes, enabling flexible and type-safe array manipulation at compile time. The `middle_index` calculation is a simple but effective way to show how the array's known size can be used safely.

* **Error Handling (commented out):** The commented-out line showing a potential out-of-bounds access illustrates Rust's safety mechanisms.  Attempting to use an index equal to the array length will cause a panic.

This revised version demonstrates a much more advanced (and more relevant) use of Rust's const generics.  It shows how to create and process arrays with sizes that are determined by calculations performed at compile time, while still guaranteeing memory safety. The inclusion of bounds checking and the error example reinforces the point.
