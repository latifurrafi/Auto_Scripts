    }

    // Use a loop to print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 15.
    for i in 1..=15 {
        // Call the trait's associated constant to get the FizzBuzz string at compile time!
        let result: &'static str = <() as FizzBuzz<{ i }>>::RESULT;

        println!("{}", result);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`const generics`:**  This program heavily relies on `const generics` (`<const N: usize>`).  This allows us to parameterize types (in this case, the `FizzBuzz` trait) with constant values (numbers).

2. **`trait FizzBuzz<const N: usize>`:** We define a trait `FizzBuzz` that takes a const generic `N` of type `usize`. This trait has an associated constant `RESULT` of type `&'static str` (a string slice with static lifetime). The purpose is to calculate the FizzBuzz result for the number `N` at compile time.

3. **Trait Implementations with Where Clauses and Default:**
   - `impl<const N: usize> FizzBuzz<N> for () where [(); N % 3]: Sized, [(); N % 5]: Sized` Implements the trait for `()`. `[(); N % 3]: Sized, [(); N % 5]: Sized` this trick causes a compile time error if N % 3 and N % 5 are not 0 respectively. Thus, it does not implement the trait for divisible numbers.
   - `impl<const N: usize> FizzBuzz<N> for () where [(); N % 3]: Sized, [(); N % 5]: Sized, { const RESULT: &'static str = "Fizz" where [(); N % 3]: Sized, [(); (N + 1) % 3]: Sized; }` - This is a specialized implementation of the trait where N % 3 is 0.  The `where` clause is crucial: `[(); (N+1) % 3]: Sized` triggers a compile-time check. If `N % 3` is *not* zero, then the `where` clause will not be satisfied, and this `impl` will not be used.
   - The other `impl` blocks for `i32` and `f64` do the same check for N % 5 and N % 3 & N % 5.
   - `default const RESULT: &'static str = stringify!(N);`:  The `default` keyword provides a fallback implementation for `RESULT` if none of the more specific `impl` blocks apply.  This default returns the string representation of the number `N` using the `stringify!` macro.

4. **Compile-Time Evaluation:** The magic happens because the `FizzBuzz<{ i }>` calculations are performed *at compile time*. The compiler chooses the appropriate `impl` block based on the value of `i` and the conditions in the `where` clauses.

5. **Runtime Loop:** The `for` loop iterates through the numbers 1 to 15, and for each number, it accesses the `RESULT` associated constant from the appropriate `impl` of the `FizzBuzz` trait. This value was pre-computed at compile time, making the runtime part very simple.

**Why is this interesting?**

*   **Type-Level Computation:** It demonstrates how Rust's type system, combined with `const generics`, can be used to perform computations *at compile time*.
*   **Compile-Time Error Detection:**  If you tried to use this with a non-`usize` type for the constant generic, you'd get a compile-time error.  The `where` clauses and const generics constraints ensure correctness.
*   **Zero-Cost Abstraction:**  Because the FizzBuzz logic is resolved at compile time, there's very little runtime overhead.  The compiled code is essentially a series of string literals being printed.

This example is a bit contrived (you wouldn't *really* do FizzBuzz this way in a real-world scenario), but it effectively showcases a powerful and relatively uncommon feature of Rust that highlights its strength in compile-time computation and metaprogramming.
