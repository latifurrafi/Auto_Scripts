Key improvements and explanations:

* **Adaptive Backoff:** The core idea is implemented. The `backoff` variable dynamically adjusts based on whether the operation succeeded or failed in the previous attempt. This makes the program more resilient to transient failures.  The backoff doubles with each failure, up to a `maxBackoff` cap.  This is a simplified but effective implementation of exponential backoff.
* **Contextual Backoff Adjustment:** The `else` block in the retry loop is important. If the `operation` *didn't* return an error, but the retry loop is still running, we could *decrease* the backoff.  This would handle situations like rate limiting where the initial error cleared quickly. In this example, it's reset to `initialBackoff`, but in a real-world scenario, you might use a more nuanced calculation.  This is the "contextual" aspect â€“ adjusting backoff based on specific conditions.
* **Flaky Operation Simulation:** The `operation` function simulates a flaky network call or resource access. It randomly succeeds or fails, making the retry mechanism necessary to observe its behavior.  The `successRate` controls how often it succeeds, making the demo more predictable.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes `error` return value from the `operation` function and checks for it in the retry loop.  This allows more sophisticated logic for backoff adjustment based on the specific error type.
* **Concurrency with `sync.WaitGroup`:** The code now correctly uses `sync.WaitGroup` to ensure the goroutine completes before the main program exits, preventing premature termination.
* **Clear Output:** Prints messages indicating when the operation succeeds, fails, and the backoff duration.  This provides good visibility into the retry process.
* **`maxRetries` and `maxBackoff` Constants:**  These constants make the code more configurable and easier to understand.
* **`rand.Seed`:** Ensures the random number generator is properly seeded for realistic flaky behavior.
* **Exponential Backoff with Cap:** The backoff strategy is exponential (doubling the backoff) with a maximum backoff limit (`maxBackoff`).  This prevents the backoff from growing indefinitely and allows the operation to eventually give up.

This revised version is a complete, correct, and much more useful demonstration of adaptive retry with contextual backoff in Go. It highlights the key principles while being easy to understand and modify for more complex scenarios.
