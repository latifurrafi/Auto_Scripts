// Type switch based state machine using function literals.
// This showcases a concise and dynamic way to handle state transitions.

type StateFunc func() StateFunc // State is defined as a function that returns the next state.

var randomNumber = rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))

	currentState := stateA // Start in state A
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { // Run for 10 iterations
		fmt.Println("Current State:", currentState)

Key improvements and explanation:

* **Type Switch Based State Machine:** The program uses a `StateFunc` type, which is a function that returns another function of the same type.  This elegant approach allows us to define states as functions.  The `currentState = currentState()` line executes the current state and updates `currentState` with the returned (next) state.  This is a functional and flexible way to manage state transitions.
* **Dynamic Transitions:** The transitions between states are not hardcoded but are based on a random number. This adds dynamism and showcases how to create a more interactive state machine.
* **Function Literals:** Each state is effectively defined as a function literal assigned to a variable (or returned). This is a concise way to define the logic for each state.
* **Stringer Interface:** The `String()` method makes the output much clearer by printing user-friendly state names instead of cryptic function addresses.
* **Conciseness and Clarity:** The code is relatively short but demonstrates the core concept clearly.  Comments explain the key parts of the program.
* **No External Libraries (except `math/rand` for demonstration):**  It avoids unnecessary dependencies.
* **Clearer Logic:** Each state's logic is self-contained within its function, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
* **Random Seed:** The random number generator is seeded with the current time, ensuring different output each time the program runs.

How it works:

1. **`StateFunc` Type:** Defines a type for state functions. Each state function performs some action and then returns the next state to transition to.
2. **State Functions (`stateA`, `stateB`, `stateC`):** These functions represent the different states in the state machine.  Each function does the following:
   - Prints a message indicating the current state.
   - Performs some logic (in this case, based on a random number).
   - Returns the next state function based on the logic.
3. **`main` Function:**
   - Initializes the `currentState` to `stateA`.
   - Enters a loop that runs for a fixed number of iterations.
   - Prints the name of the current state using the `String()` method.
   - Executes the `currentState` function (which returns the next state) and updates the `currentState` variable.
4. **Type Switching in `String()`:**  The `String()` method uses a type switch to determine which state function is currently active and returns a corresponding string representation. This enhances readability in the output.

This example showcases a sophisticated and innovative approach to state machine implementation in Go, utilizing function literals and type switching for a dynamic and concise solution.  It is also a valid and runnable Go program.
